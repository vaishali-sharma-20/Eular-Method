# Eular-Method
Here, Code of  Eular Method of Computer Oriented Numerical Methods in Java Language. The Euler method algorithm is a numerical method which is used to solve the first order differential equation of the form y’ = f(x,y) where ‘x’ represents the independent variable and ‘y’ represents the dependent variable. 
# Project title

Eular Method


## Motivation

A University Assignment. Clearly Used to Solve anhy Porblem and Perform Computer Oriented Prolblems .


## Method and results

Start
Define function
Get the values of x0, y0, h and xn
*Here x0 and y0 are the initial conditions
h is the interval
xn is the required value
n = (xn – x0)/h + 1
Start loop from i=1 to n
y = y0 + h*f(x0,y0)
x = x + h
Print values of y0 and x0
Check if x < xn
If yes, assign x0 = x and y0 = y
If no, goto 9.
End loop i
Stop
