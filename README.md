# Eular-Method
Here, Code of  Eular Method of Computer Oriented Numerical Methods in Java Language. The Euler method algorithm is a numerical method which is used to solve the first order differential equation of the form y’ = f(x,y) where ‘x’ represents the independent variable and ‘y’ represents the dependent variable.
