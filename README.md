# Eular-Method
Here, Code of  Eular Method of Computer Oriented Numerical Methods in Java Language. The Euler method algorithm is a numerical method which is used to solve the first order differential equation of the form y’ = f(x,y) where ‘x’ represents the independent variable and ‘y’ represents the dependent variable. 
# Project title

Eular Method


## Motivation

A University Assignment. Clearly Used to Solve anhy Porblem and Perform Computer Oriented Prolblems .


## Method and results

1. Start

2. Define function f(x,y)

3. Read values of initial condition(x0 and y0), 
   number of steps (n) and calculation point (xn)
   
4. Calculate step size (h) = (xn - x0)/b

5. Set i=0

6. Loop 
      
      yn = y0 + h *  f(x0 + i*h, y0) 
      
      y0 = yn
      
      i = i + 1

   While i < n

7. Display yn as result

8. Stop
